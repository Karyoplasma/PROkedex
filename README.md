# PROkedex
A simple spawn parser for PRO. Just wrote it because Reborn is down.

Searches for spawns of Pokemon either via area name or Pokemon name. Halfway passable repel trick filter is also available, but it currently doesn't understand multi-repel spawns (such as Pinsir/Scyther in Safari Area 1).

Requirements:

-Java RE (any above 6 should be fine, so if you downloaded it in the past 10 years, you're good)

Uses:

-JSON Simple library (packaged into the jar)

-Spawn dumps from the PRO website.
