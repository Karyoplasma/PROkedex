# PROkedex
A simple spawn parser for PRO. Just wrote it because Reborn is down.

Searches for spawns of Pokemon either via area name or Pokemon name. Halfway passable repel trick filter is also available, but it currently doesn't understand multi-repel spawns (such as Pinsir/Scyther in Safari Area 1). Hey, my QA was me using it for about 2 hours and it always did what I wanted it to, so there's that.
I've also added a suggestion for a farming route if you enter a Pokemon's name. The predictor suggests a route based on the predicted spawn rate which entirely banks on my data collection (about 50k encounters in total). Not really sure how good it is, but you can try it out and report back!

Requirements:

-Java RE (any above 6 should be fine, so if you downloaded it in the past 10 years, you're good)

Uses:

-JSON Simple library (packaged into the jar)

-Spawn dumps from the PRO website.
